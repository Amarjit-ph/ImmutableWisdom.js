# Object-Oriented Programming
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that organizes code into objects, which represent real-world entities with data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Instead of writing long procedural code, OOP structures programs using classes (blueprints) that create reusable objects. The four main principles of OOP—Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction—help in keeping code modular, reusable, and easy to maintain. This approach solves issues like code duplication, security risks, and scalability by ensuring that different parts of a program are independent yet interconnected in a structured way.

### Key Benefits of OOP:
- Reusability → Write once, reuse multiple times with classes & inheritance.
- Maintainability → Organized code is easier to debug & update.
- Scalability → Easily add new features without breaking old ones.
- Encapsulation → Keeps data secure by restricting access.
- Polymorphism → Use a single interface for different types of objects.
- Abstraction → Hides complex details, showing only necessary features.

### How OOP Solves the Spaghetti Code Problem in Procedural Programming:
Procedural programming often leads to spaghetti code, where functions and variables are scattered across the program without clear organization. As the codebase grows, it becomes hard to read, debug, and modify, since everything is tightly coupled and dependent on execution order. OOP solves this by structuring code into objects, encapsulating data and behaviors together, making it modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.


## Four Pillars of OOP
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is built on four fundamental principles that ensure code is structured, reusable, and maintainable. These principles—Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction—help in organizing complex systems by breaking them into manageable, modular components. They enhance security, flexibility, and scalability, making OOP a preferred approach for large-scale software development.

Key Pillars of OOP:
- Encapsulation → Hides internal details and protects data using private variables and methods.
- Inheritance → Allows new classes to reuse properties and behaviors of existing classes.
- Polymorphism → Enables different objects to use the same method but behave differently.
- Abstraction → Hides complex implementation and exposes only essential details.

# Objects

An object is a collection of key-value pairs that store related data and functions. Objects can be created using the Object constructor or object literals, which provide a simple and readable way to define objects using {}. Object literals are widely used because they make code concise, easy to read, and maintainable.

### Key Points:
- Object → A data structure that holds properties (key-value pairs) and methods.
- Object Literal → A shorthand way to define objects using { key: value }.
- Readable & Simple → Object literals make object creation concise and clear.
- No Constructor Needed → Unlike new Object(), object literals require no extra syntax.
- Easily Expandable → You can dynamically add properties and methods.

## Factory function

A factory function is a function that returns objects without using the new keyword. It provides a flexible and reusable way to create multiple instances of an object, making it useful when dealing with dynamic object creation. Factory functions help avoid redundancy and make code more scalable and maintainable.

Key Points:
- Creates Objects → Returns a new object each time it's called.
- No new Keyword → Unlike constructors, it doesn’t require new.
- Encapsulation → Keeps object creation logic inside a function.
- Reusable → Easily generate multiple objects with different values.

```js
function createCar(brand, model) {
    return {
        brand,
        model,
        drive() {
            console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model} is driving`);
        }
    };
}

const car1 = createCar("Tesla", "Model S");
const car2 = createCar("BMW", "X5");

car1.drive(); // Tesla Model S is driving
car2.drive(); // BMW X5 is driving
```

## Constructors
A constructor function is a special function used to create and initialize objects using the new keyword. It acts as a blueprint for creating multiple objects with the same properties and methods. Constructors help in making object creation structured, reusable, and scalable.

Key Points:
- Creates Objects → Used to instantiate multiple objects from a blueprint.
- Uses new Keyword → Must be called with new to return an object.
- Capitalized Name → By convention, constructor functions start with an uppercase letter.
- Reusability → Helps avoid redundant object definitions.

## Constructor Property
The constructor property is an inbuilt property of JavaScript objects that references the function that created the object. It helps identify the constructor used to create an object and can be useful for debugging or checking object types dynamically.

Key Points:
- References the Creator Function → Points to the function that constructed the object.
- Available on All Objects → Every object inherits the constructor property.
- Useful for Type Checking → Helps determine an object’s constructor.
- Can Be Overwritten → Can be manually changed, but rarely needed.

```js
function Car(brand) {
    this.brand = brand;
}

const myCar = new Car("Tesla");

console.log(myCar.constructor); // Outputs: [Function: Car]
console.log(myCar.constructor === Car); // true
```

## Functions are Objects
In JavaScript, functions are also objects, meaning they can have properties and methods like any other object. This allows functions to store data, be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and even have their own methods. This flexibility makes JavaScript a powerful functional programming language.

Key Points:
- Functions Have Properties → Can store data like objects.
- Can Be Assigned → Functions can be stored in variables.
- Can Be Passed Around → Used as arguments in other functions (higher-order functions).
- Can Have Methods → Functions can have their own methods and properties.
```js
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}

greet.language = "English"; // Adding a property to the function

console.log(greet.language); // Outputs: English
greet(); // Outputs: Hello!
```


## Value vs Reference Types

Data types are categorized into value types (primitives) and reference types (objects). Value types store data directly in memory, while reference types store a reference (or address) to the actual data in memory. This affects how data is copied and compared.

```Primitives are copied independently, while objects share the same reference! ```

Key Points:
- Value Types (Primitives) → Stored directly in memory.
- Reference Types (Objects) → Stored as a reference (memory address).
- Copying Behavior → Value types create independent copies, while reference types share the same memory location.
- Comparison → Value types compare actual values, while reference types compare memory addresses.

```js
// Value Type (Primitive)
let a = 10;
let b = a;  // Copying value
b = 20;
console.log(a); // 10 (unchanged)
console.log(b); // 20

// Reference Type (Object)
let obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
let obj2 = obj1;  // Copying reference
obj2.name = "Bob";
console.log(obj1.name); // Bob (changed because obj1 and obj2 reference the same object)
```

## Adding or Removing Properties
In JavaScript, objects are dynamic, meaning you can add or remove properties at any time. You can access and modify properties using dot notation (.) or bracket notation ([]). Bracket notation is useful when property names are dynamic or contain special characters.

Key Points:
- Adding Properties → Use object.property = value or object["property"] = value.
- Removing Properties → Use delete object.property.
- Bracket Notation → Needed for dynamic keys or when property names contain spaces or special characters.

```js
let person = { name: "Alice" };

// Adding properties
person.age = 25;  // Using dot notation
person["city"] = "New York";  // Using bracket notation

// Removing properties
delete person.age;

console.log(person); // { name: 'Alice', city: 'New York' }

// Using bracket notation with dynamic property name
let key = "email";
person[key] = "alice@example.com"; // Adding dynamically
console.log(person.email); // Outputs: alice@example.com
```
## Enumerating Properties
Enumerating properties means iterating over an object's keys to access its values. JavaScript provides multiple ways to do this, such as for...in loop, Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries(). These methods help when you need to process or display object properties dynamically.

Key Points:
- for...in Loop → Iterates over all enumerable properties of an object.
- Object.keys(obj) → Returns an array of property names (keys).
- Object.values(obj) → Returns an array of property values.
- Object.entries(obj) → Returns an array of key-value pairs.

```js
let person = { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" };

// Using for...in loop
for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key, person[key]); // name Alice, age 25, city New York
}

// Using Object.keys()
console.log(Object.keys(person)); // ["name", "age", "city"]

// Using Object.values()
console.log(Object.values(person)); // ["Alice", 25, "New York"]

// Using Object.entries()
console.log(Object.entries(person)); // [["name", "Alice"], ["age", 25], ["city", "New York"]]

```
## Abstraction , Private Properties and Methods
Abstraction is the concept of hiding unnecessary details and exposing only what's essential. In JavaScript, private properties and methods help achieve abstraction by restricting direct access to certain parts of an object. This improves security, maintainability, and prevents unintended modifications.

Key Points:
✔ Abstraction → Hides complex logic, exposing only what’s needed.
✔ Private Properties/Methods → Use # (private fields) or closures to keep data hidden.
✔ Encapsulation → Prevents direct modification of internal object states.
✔ Better Security → Protects sensitive data from external changes.

```js
class Car {
    #engineStatus = "off"; // Private property

    start() {
        this.#toggleEngine(true);
        console.log("Car started");
    }

    #toggleEngine(status) { // Private method
        this.#engineStatus = status ? "on" : "off";
    }
}

const myCar = new Car();
myCar.start(); // Car started
console.log(myCar.#engineStatus); // ❌ Error: Private field not accessible
```
## Getters and Setters
Getters and setters allow controlled access to object properties. A getter (get) retrieves a property value, while a setter (set) modifies it. They help encapsulate logic, validate data, and restrict direct property modification, making objects more secure and maintainable.

Key Points:
✔ Getter (get) → Allows reading a property like a variable.
✔ Setter (set) → Controls modification of a property with validation.
✔ Encapsulation → Hides direct property access and enforces rules.
✔ Improves Security → Prevents invalid data from being set.
```js
class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this._name = name; // Convention: Use _ for internal properties
    }

    get name() {
        return this._name.toUpperCase(); // Custom logic while getting
    }

    set name(newName) {
        if (newName.length > 2) {
            this._name = newName; // Custom validation
        } else {
            console.log("Name must be at least 3 characters long");
        }
    }
}

const person = new Person("Alice");
console.log(person.name); // ALICE (Getter in action)

person.name = "Bo"; // ❌ Invalid (Setter validation)
person.name = "Bob"; // ✅ Valid update
console.log(person.name); // BOB
```
